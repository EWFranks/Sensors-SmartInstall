These are a few example logs from the sensor network implementation housed in Rayzor 2015. These logs should show what fields are being recorded from the sensors and sent to Knowledge Core, and the approximate format that the data should arrive in.

The format for the logs are bound to change overtime, and sensors may be added, removed, or moved around as time goes on.

As of now, the prototype network consists of different sensor hubs that send data to a host computer, which then generates data fields based on the readings from the sensor and any additional information that may be necessary, such as the model and location of the responding sensor hub.
